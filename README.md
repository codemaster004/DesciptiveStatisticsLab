## Contributing

**!!! Before you begin work on ANY tasks REMEMBER TO PULL !!!**

Remember the safest way to not mess anything up is to not change any settings or buttons.

### Git integraion with RStudio

You may find `Tab Git` in RStudio in the Top Right corner of the project window.

Before you begin work make sure a proper branch is selected. In the `Git` window on the right 3 buttons should be present.

- **New Branch**
- **some text**
- **Refresh icon**

Please make sure a middle button says `dev` if not click on it and select option `dev`, close the popup that should have appeared.

**Once again make sure to PULL changes**

Now you may start working on tasks.

### Submitting you work

**Before you contribute remember to PULL changes**

After you are done with your tasks go to `git` tab press `commit` button.

A window should appear asking about **saved** files that you want to commit and to provide a description of what you did.

When you are done click the `commit` button and after that `push` button.
